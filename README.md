# Focus Buffer
Hollow Knight mod that allows for various input buffers. Requires [Vasi](https://github.com/fifty-six/HollowKnight.Vasi/tree/master/Vasi).

You can buffer jumps during:
- Focus/Spells/Superdash/Dream Nail
- Falling without being able to double jump
- Dashing
- Recoiling

You can buffer dash during:
- Focus/Spells/Superdash/Dream Nail
- In mid-air after dash was already used
- During dash cooldown
- Recoiling

You can buffer attacks during:
- Focus/Spells/Superdash/Dream Nail
- During attack cooldown
- Dashing
- Recoiling

You can buffer spell casts during:
- Focus/Spells/Superdash/Dream Nail
- Dashing
- Recoiling

The duration of the above inputs being buffered can be controlled with a global setting.

You can also buffer Focus, Dream Nail and Superdash (not controlled by a buffer duration, since they always rely on the input being held).
