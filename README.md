# Input Buffers
Hollow Knight mod that allows for various input buffers. Requires [Vasi](https://github.com/fifty-six/HollowKnight.Vasi/tree/master/Vasi).

The mod provides toggles (in Mod Menu) for buffering the following inputs:
- Jump
- Dash
- Attack
- Cast
- Quick Cast
- Focus
- Dream Nail
- Superdash

You can also adjust the duration that a buffered input lasts for. Default is 300 ms.

There is also a toggle to auto-release superdash. When the setting is on, you need to hold the direction you are facing.
